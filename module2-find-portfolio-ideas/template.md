## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Robots: What areas have higher interests in robots?
Education: What areas have higher gradution rates?

2. Trend related to the news
Robots: How quickly is automation taking our jobs?
Education: Do schools with a lower student to teacher ratio have a higher graduation rates?

3. Who does that?
Robots: What age range purchases the most robots?
Education: What is the average age people stop furthering their education?

4. Answering a question people care about
Robots: Are robots safe?
Education: Is the amount of funding for a school an important factor in graduation rates?

5. Valuable to businesses
Robot: Will this robot be able to reduce costs and up efficency? 
Education: Graduation rates of college students funded by a buissness? 

6. What's the most popular?
Robots: What is the most popular google search pretaining to robots?
Education: What education level is sufficient for getting a job?

7. Cost/Money rankings
Robots: What robot parts are the most expensive?
Education: Which colleges are the most expensive to attend without a scholorship? 

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
Robots: Robots will one day take over the world(irobot style)
Education: Students who go to expensive schools are better than ones who did not. 

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
Robots: 1
Education: 3

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Robots: Is higher population density a factor in robotic interest?
Education: Does the average person stop furthering their education after highschool?

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
Robots: What areas have the least amount of robots?
Education: What economic class is more likely to further their education?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
N/a
